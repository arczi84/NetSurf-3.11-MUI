NetSurf is the only CSS capable web browser on AmigaOS 3.x also available
for many other platforms including RiscOS, Linux, Haiku and Atari.
It is based on sdl framebuffer frontend but adds more functions to GUI.
The 68k code is not related to NetSurf for OS4 and is not representative of 
the user interface of NetSurf on any other platform.

Please report any bugs or requests to my e-mail. Any feedback is appreciated.
